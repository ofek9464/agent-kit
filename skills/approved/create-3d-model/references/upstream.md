# Upstream provenance

## Primary skill source

- Repository: https://github.com/RobLe3/cc-blender-skill
- Reviewed commit: `11016c9a5847897491dde935c346571bd7548e3d`
- Release: `1.3.0`
- Commit date: `2026-05-01`
- License: MIT; see [UPSTREAM_LICENSE](../UPSTREAM_LICENSE), in the skill root.

The upstream release contains 30 chain-loadable Claude Code skills led by `text-to-blender`. This Codex adaptation exposes the output-oriented `create-3d-model` orchestrator and retains the other 29 skills as English reference modules. It also retains all 26 Python helpers and the three orchestrator references for assembly order, Blender version compatibility, and common object dimensions.

Validation render assets, trigger-eval datasets, development journals, changelogs, and repository-only documentation were not copied because they do not provide runtime capability. Module recipes, domain references, and executable helpers were retained.

## Codex adaptations

- Replace Claude-specific tool assumptions with semantic Blender MCP capability discovery that tolerates Codex namespace differences.
- Replace top-level multi-skill registration with one skill plus on-demand module reads.
- Rename the entry point around the normal deliverable rather than one input modality or the Blender implementation detail; support text, image, wireframe, multiview, texture/template, and existing-asset inputs.
- Treat a portable 3D model as the default primary artifact and `.blend` as its editable engineering source.
- Add explicit existing-scene protections, versioned saves, durable workspace artifacts, Codex quick-open file links, and visual-evidence gates.
- Keep external asset and AI generation services disabled unless explicitly authorized.
- Prevent the quality-refinement module from editing skills, documentation, Git state, or remotes during ordinary Blender work.
- Preserve upstream English recipes and helper scripts instead of translating or condensing away domain behavior.

## Blender MCP dependency

- Repository: https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp
- License: MIT
- Role: external Codex MCP server and Blender add-on; it is intentionally not bundled with this skill.

Follow the repository installation guide to register BlenderMCP with Codex. Pin a known-good release or commit when reproducibility matters.
